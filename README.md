# Module 9: Lab Activity – While Loops
This repository contains four Python programs demonstrating the use of while loops:
- Problem1Infinite.py – Prints “Infinite” in an infinite loop.
- Problem2NumList10.py – Builds a list of numbers from 0 to 10 using a while loop.
- Problem3NumList35.py – Repeatedly asks the user for numbers until their sum exceeds 100.
- Problem4NumListDivide.py – Appends numbers divisible by 10 (from 0 to 50) to a list.

Each file includes comments with my name, the date, and a brief problem description.
